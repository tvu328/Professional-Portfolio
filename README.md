# Professional-Portfolio

## Description
This is the start of a professional portfolio specific to my professional and academic progress. This portfolio will allow companies and employers to view my accolades as an aspiring software developer as well as being able to deploy and check out my future projects and applications. In doing so will help me network and eventually find the right ways to fully sharpen my portfolio to be hire-ready.

## Installation
No installation needed for this portfolio. 

## Usage
From the front page, you will have four links across a navigation bar that will take you to a certain section of the page. In each of those links are more details about myself and my previous/current work. 
For the "About Me" link, it will be describing small details about myself and my journey to starting software development.
For the "Work" link, it will be filled with previous and current work throughout this course.
For the "Contacts" page, there will be ways to contact me through via phone and/or email.
For the "Resume" page, there will be a link that will redirect you to my profile on LinkedIn.
